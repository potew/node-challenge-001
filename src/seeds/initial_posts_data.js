          first_paragraph: 'Example: people are asked to think of their social security number and then estimate the height of a tree. People with higher social security numbers are more likely to pick higher estimates for the height of a tree.',
          body: `Anchoring is a psychological effect whereby people's estimates of numbers or values are affected by previous but unrelated numbers or values. In other words, their guess of a number is "anchored" to the previous number.
          Anchoring also plays a big role in investing.
          Avalanche was at $5 a few weeks ago. A common fallacy is that it has already done a 10x, therefore it can't rise much more. Rather than thinking fundamentally what avalanche is worth, people are anchored to the fact that it was $5 a few weeks ago.
          If Avalanche was trading at $20 for most of 2020 instead of $5, then these same people would be happy to buy avalanche, because its only done 2.5x, surely it can do more.
          This is irrational thinking. Instead, we should look at avalanche's fundamentals and compare it to similar projects.
          Firstly, what is avalanche? Broadly, it's an eth competitor. Similar to say Polkadot or Cardano. They all have, or aim to have smart contracts, programmable money, fast transactions etc.
          Ok, so how does Avalanche compare to Cardano or Polkadot?`,
